**MNC Expansion in Georgia**

By: Kalifa Kouyate, Shammah Matasva, and Trey Matthews

**Executive Summary:** 

********To expand operations, our multinational company assigned our group with the task of investigating Georgia as a potential candidate for expansion. As a company in the apparel industry, we are looking for a country that supports low cost production with a stable and open economy. Georgia, at a glance, provides many desirable qualities for foreign direct investment (FDI) including a reportedly low cost of labor, a democratic republic government structure, and a free market economy (Solutions, n.d.). However, many of the favorable traits are shared by Georgia’s neighboring countries. To conclude whether or not Georgia is an ideal country for FDI, our group conducted data analysis comparing significant economic indicators between Georgia and its neighboring countries. In our analysis, we discovered that Georgia has maintained a significant increase in GDP per capita since 2020. In addition, unlike their neighbors, Georgia has maintained stable improvement in real interest growth rates. Georgia also proved to be the most attractive business/political environment with leading scores in corruption control and regulatory quality. After conducting our analysis, we feel that it is vital for our company to expand operations into Georgia due its economic superiority conditions in a strategic location.

**Background:**

********As a multinational company in the apparel industry, we are always looking to expand operations into countries that allow for the most efficient production. It is in our best interest to expand into countries with access to a labor force that is both cost-efficient and cost-effective. In addition, economic and political stability, high economic freedom, and low production costs are favorable factors to consider. With the mission of finding ideal countries to expand operations into, our group has been tasked with investigating Georgia as a potential candidate.

Georgia is a small country located at the crossroads between Europe and Asia in a region known as the South Caucasus. Georgia is run by a democratic republic, a governmental system that correlates with better investment climates and economic freedom (Freedom House, n.d.). Additionally, Georgia operates under a free-market economy, which should allow for minimal government intervention (Team, 2024). With these considerations, Georgia should be a favorable location to expand our operations in theory. However, despite this, more in-depth data analysis is required to truly understand Georgia’s current economic conditions.

**Problem Statement:**

Our company must decide whether or not Georgia provides an economic environment ideal for expanding our operations. 

**Data:**

We are utilizing data for Georgia and its neighboring countries: the Russian Federation, Turkiye, Armenia, and Azerbaijan from a World Bank database (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). The data has been compiled into a dataset ranging from 2013 to 2023 

The key variables in focus are:

1. Control of corruption percentile rank

2. Real interest rate

3. GDP per capita

4. Population

- Descriptive Statistics of the dataset:

  - The dataset has 55 records and a total of 24 variables, of which 19 are significant for analysis. From the 19, we selected 4 variables to work with.

| --------------------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Variable              | Min       | Mean       | Median    | Max         |
| Control of corruption | `4.245`   | `30.958`   | `23.585`  | `70.673`    |
| Real interest rate    | `-16.523` | `7.898`    | `7.898`   | `28.945`    |
| GDP per capita        | `3512`    | `7670`     | `7126`    | `15941`     |
| Population            | `2961500` | `48496671` | `9939771` | `145453291` |
|                       |           |            |           |             |

Georgia has experienced substantial GDP growth since 2020, when it started recovering from a contraction during the COVID-19 pandemic(_Georgia_. (n.d.). CNN.). The trend is similar across its neighbors that also had contractions in 2019.

Georgia shows a positive real interest growth rate between 2021 and 2023 compared to its neighboring countries, which have high fluctuations or no growth in the case of Turkey.

Compared to its neighbors, Georgia has the second smallest population size.

**Findings:**

Georgia has demonstrated strong GDP growth since 2020, showing an effective recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic ("Georgia's unprecedented economic growth," n.d.). This upward trend indicates economic resilience and suggests potential for sustained expansion, making the country an attractive destination for business operations (Dept, 2024).

The nation maintains stable real interest rates that have shown consistent positive growth, contrasting with the volatility experienced by neighboring countries like Turkey (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). This financial stability creates a predictable environment that supports long-term investment decisions (Dept, 2024).

In terms of governance, Georgia achieves moderate scores in corruption control (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). While this reflects a relatively transparent business environment compared to regional peers (Freedom House, n.d.), opportunities remain for improvement to reach higher international standards.

Georgia's labor market presents strategic advantages with its modest but sufficient population size (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). When combined with competitive production costs and a free-market economy (Team, 2024), these factors create favorable conditions for cost-efficient business operations.

Georgia's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia further enhances its appeal as an expansion destination (Freedom House, n.d.), offering logistical benefits for supply chain management and regional market access.

**Recommendations:**

Georgia’s stable economy, strategic location, and improving business environment make it a strong candidate for expansion. To maximize success, we should establish operations while implementing robust compliance measures to address corruption risks. Partnering with local firms will optimize supply chains, and targeted training programs will develop the skilled workforce needed for efficient production. This balanced approach ensures cost-effective operations while supporting long-term growth in the region.
